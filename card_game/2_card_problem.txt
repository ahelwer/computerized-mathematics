Say you and a friend are playing a game with cards.

To begin, you both draw cards.
You put your own card on your forehead, so the other player can see what you have (but you cannot see what your own card is)

On the count of three (to prevent ANY, including nonverbal communication), you both say a card color.

The game is won if either of you guess your own card's color correctly

You may discuss strategy beforehand.


What strategy, if any, gives a garunteed win state?
